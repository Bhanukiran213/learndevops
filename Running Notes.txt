#echo $SHELL -> to see the present shell in the server.

#which $SHELL command will give you current shell and we can see available shell in /etc/shells file

Launching models of ec2 instances:

EBS is like a hard disk for ec2 instance.
EBS volumes are block level store
EBS offers different types of volumes designed for different use cases.
EBS volumes are persistent, that is data stored is permanent.
EBS volumes are highly durable, scalable
AWS manages redundant copies(2 copies) of the same data in the same AZ.
We can detach a volume from an instance and attach to different instances.
At any point of time EBS volumes can be resized(can increase but can’t decrease)
Can we migrate EBS volume to another AZ or Region?
Yeah, take a snapshot(EBS backup) and move it.
Backups of EBS volumes are called snapshots, backups are stored in S3(Simple Storage Service)
Root Volume & EBS Volume
Root volume is the main volume where operating system is hosted
EBS volume is the additional volume, where we run applications.
Can we encrypt root and data volumes?
Yes
How do you attach new EBS volumes?(FAQ)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html

Create EBS Volume
Attach volume to EC2
Log on to EC2 and list volumes
lsblk
Create file system( don’t create file system if you are restoring from snapshot)
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
Create mount point
sudo mkdir /app
Mount the disk on above path
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /app/
Automount EBS volume when ec2 reboots.
Make an entry in fstab file 

EBS Volume Exercises
Attach additional volume, Configure auto mount for newly attached volumes
Check how to resize newly added volumes





Now, login to your ec2 instance and list the available disks using the following command.

 lsblk
 
 Check if the volume has any data using the following command.
 
 sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
 
 Format the volume to the ext4 filesystem using the following command.
 
 sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
 
 Create a directory of your choice to mount our new ext4 volume. I am using the name “newvolume“. You can name it something meaningful to you.

sudo mkdir /newvolume

Mount the volume to “newvolume” directory using the following command.

sudo mount /dev/xvdf /newvolume/

cd into newvolume directory and check the disk space to validate the volume mount.

cd /newvolume
df -h .



To unmount the volume, use the unmount command as shown below..

umount /dev/xvdf



Step 1: Back up the /etc/fstab file.

sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
Step 2: Open /etc/fstab file and make an entry in the following format.

device_name mount_point file_system_type fs_mntops fs_freq fs_passno
For example,

/dev/xvdf       /newvolume   ext4    defaults,nofail        0       0
Step 3: Execute the following command to check id the fstab file has any error.

sudo mount -a

Lab:
Launch one ec2-instance
create a volume with the size 30G
Attach it to ec2-instance
create some files in new disk
Add the disk to oslevel
rebbot the server and check the status

EBS: Performance is measured by 

IOPS: Read/Write I/O (IPOS)
Latency: Time between I/O Submision and completion(ms)
Throughput: Read/Write transfer rate(MB/s)

maven---->

Ant----> build.xml

Ant doesn't have fromal conversion, so we need to provide the inforamtion
of the project structure in build.xml.

Ant is procedural, you neede to provide inforamtion about what to do through code, you need to provide the order


Ant doesn't have any life cylcle


it is a build tool
Ant scripts are not reusuable


Maven----> pom.xml
Mavenn ha a conversion to place source code, compiled code etc. so we doesn't need to provie inforamtion about the project strucu=ture in pom.xml

There is alife cycled for mavwn

it is a framework

It is mainly a project managemewnt tool

scripts are reusuable
